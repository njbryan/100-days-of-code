# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:
Completed the LaunchSool RB100 "More Stuff" and half of the "Exercises" chapter. 

**Thoughts:** 
I am splitting my coding time between VS Code and Vim as I believe being productive in both is a useful habit.

I should be finished the exercises tomorrow and start Chris Pine's Ruby book.
