# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: March 30, 2020
Finished first two chapters of Learn to Code by Chris Pine's Learn to Code.

### Day 2: March 29, 2020
**Today's Progress**
I tapped out and read the solution to the bonus question.

**Thoughts**
I'm eager to get through the Chris Pine book because I clearly need more practice using some of the Ruby methods to solve more complex data structure manipulations.

### Day 1: March 28, 2020
**Today's Progress**
Completed all but the last exercise in RB100. 

**Thoughts**
I spent a long time solving problems in ways that were more complicated then neccessary. 

### Day 0: March 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:
Completed the Launch School RB100 "More Stuff" and half of the "Exercises" chapter. 

**Thoughts:** 
I am splitting my coding time between VS Code and Vim as I believe being productive in both is a useful habit.

I should be finished the exercises tomorrow and start Chris Pine's Ruby book.
